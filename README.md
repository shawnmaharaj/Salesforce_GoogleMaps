# Salesforce_GoogleMaps

Simple implementation of google maps integrated with Angular 1.X in Force.com.

Force.com usings Apex and VisualForce pages. This application contains a test module (TestSuite.cls) and other smaller apex classes not needed for the example (Person.js, PersonController.cls, PersonController1.cls, etc).

The static resource files including Angular.js have to be resaved on the Force.com server. The database schema also need to be recreated on Force.com Schema Builder (DatabaseTablesToCreate.png).

A google maps API key is needed to complete http geocode requests and generate the actual map.
